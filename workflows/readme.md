# Workflow Catalogue

This path contains a catalogue of the workflows that will be developed in DComEX 


Initially, it won't be possible to give precise descriptions, however even basic descriptions will help during the initial planning phase of the project.
The descriptions can be updated over time, as we start to work on the workflows and get a better understanding of their requirements.

To add a new workflow make a copy of the `template.md` and fill it in. See the main `readme.md` for more detailed instructions.

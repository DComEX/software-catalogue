## Workflow Description

Target audience, problem being solved.

## Required software.

Software components from the software catalogue used by the workflow

## Resources Required.

Describe the workload: will it require running thousands of long running small simulations that can fit on a GPU via Korali? Will the simulations themselves span multiple GPUs/nodes?

## Input Data

A clear specification of the input data to use (e.g., Tumor evolution, medical images, structural data)

## Output Data

A clear specification of the output data to expect as result of the workflow (e.g., calibrated model parameters)

## Data Flow Diagram

A data flow diagram that shows the interactions (intput/outputs) of all the software/system components of the workflow
